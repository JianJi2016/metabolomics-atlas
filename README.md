# Metabolism of mice brain
This is a project for visulization of metabolites in mice brains.

The metabolomic atlas of aging mouse brain is a publicly available database of mouse brain metabolome. 
It currently contains 1823 annotated metabolites. 
Users are able to explore the distribution of interested metabolites across 10 anatomical brain regions over 3 ages, results will be presented in a mapping form.
